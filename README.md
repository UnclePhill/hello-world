Ello Govna!

This is Uncle Phill. No, I'm not the uncle your family warned you about. I'm the kind and easy going guy who is trying to better himself.I am a novice programmer who is just trying to learn one language in and out before his starts working with multiple languages. I have already learned a small amount in multiple languages (C++, VBscript, Bash, Batch, Python, and Powershell), but I am planning on making Javascript my first fully (or mostly) known programming language. Wish me luck!
